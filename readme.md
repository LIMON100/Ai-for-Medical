# Medical Image Format:

## DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine)
  
It is the internaiton standard for medical images related information. It defines the formats for medical images that can be excahnged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use. 


## NIFTI (Neuroimaging informatics Technology Initiative)

The Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIFTI) is a standard format for storing neuroimaging data, commonly used in medical imaging, particularly in fields like neuroscience, psychology, and medical diagnostics. It provides a way to store and share volumetric data, such as MRI and CT scan data, in a consistent, open format.

    3D Image Storage: NIFTI files support multi-dimensional arrays, typically representing 3D volumes (x, y, z) and even time-series data.
    
    Metadata Support: NIFTI files include metadata for crucial information, such as voxel dimensions, orientation, and spatial resolution, making it easier to analyze and interpret the data accurately.
    
    File Types: The format includes two versions: .nii files (single-file format) and .hdr/.img files (split header and image data).
    
    Cross-Platform Compatibility: As an open standard, NIFTI is supported across various neuroimaging software and research environments (e.g., FSL, SPM, and AFNI), promoting collaboration and data sharing.
    
    Compact and Efficient: It allows compression and efficient storage, which is crucial when handling large imaging datasets.
